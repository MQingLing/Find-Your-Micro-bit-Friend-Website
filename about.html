                <h2>Benefits</h2>
                <p>"Find Your Micro:bit Friend" offers targeted navigation assistance to people with hearing impairments, providing a tactile approach for detecting the distance between familiar individuals. This can be particularly useful in social settings such as workplaces, or the common spaces where traditional visual or auditory cues may be inadequate. It makes Alerts and Social Interactions easier.

                    <br>
                    With our invention "Finding Friends", it will allow YOU to find your friends so much easier without going through any hassle or trouble even in a crowd! With just a spike in the number of LEDs on the microbit itself, you will know that your friends are closer and closer to you...    
                    <br>
                    <br>
